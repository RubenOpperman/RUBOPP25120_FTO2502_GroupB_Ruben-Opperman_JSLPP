# Kanban Board UI Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a fully responsive user interface built based on a Figma design. The main objective was to accurately recreate the layout using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on clean code structure and responsive styling.

JavaScript has been added to introduce interactivity. The application loads tasks from an array of objects and displays them within their respective columns. When a task is clicked, a modal appears, giving the impression that the task can be edited—however, the edit functionality is not yet implemented.

There is a new add task button that displays a modal if you click it.Then you enter all the task information and the if you save the changes then the task displays and is also added to the existing array that is stored in the local storage for data persistence.
